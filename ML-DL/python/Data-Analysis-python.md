### **1. NumPy**

NumPy is a Python library that provides a simple yet powerful data structure: the n-dimensional array. This is the foundation on which almost all the power of Python's data science toolkit is built, and learning NumPy is the first step on any Python data scientist's journey.

#### **1. Importing NumPy**

First thing's first, you need to import the library using the standard line:

```python
import numpy as np
```

The `as np` is optional, you could technically import numpy as any name you want. However, `np` is standard throughout the data science community.

#### **2. Creating NumPy Arrays**

There are many ways to create arrays in NumPy. Here are some common methods:

- **From a Python list or tuples**

```python
# 1D array
np.array([1, 2, 3])  # Output: array([1, 2, 3])

# 2D array
a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])  # Output: array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])

# specifying the data type
b = np.array([1, 2, 3], dtype='float32')

print(a.shape)  # tuple representing dimensions, Output: (2, 2)
print(a.dtype)  # data type of array elements, Output: int64
```

- **Using built-in NumPy functions**

```python
np.zeros(2)  # Output: array([0., 0.])  -- 1D array with 2 zeros
np.ones((2,2))  # Output: array([[1., 1.], [1., 1.]]) -- 2D array with ones
np.arange(4)  # Output: array([0, 1, 2, 3]) -- 1D array with sequential integers
np.linspace(0, 1, 5)  # Output: array([0.  , 0.25, 0.5 , 0.75, 1.  ]) -- Equally spaced points between 0 and 1
np.eye(3)  # Output: array([[1., 0., 0.], [0., 1., 0.], [0., 0., 1.]]) -- Identity matrix of size 3
np.random.random((2, 2))  # Output: array with random numbers between 0 and 1
```

#### **3. Converting Arrays to NumPy Arrays**

You can convert a list or tuple to a NumPy array using the `np.array` function.

```python
lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
np_lst = np.array(lst)
type(np_lst)  # Output: <class 'numpy.ndarray'>
```

#### **4. Accessing Data**

You can use indexing and slicing to access data in a NumPy array, just like in a Python list.

```python
# arrays
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
b = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
c = np.array([1, 2, 3], dtype='float32')
```

```python

a[0]  # Output: 1
a[1:3]  # Output: array([2, 3])
```

For multi-dimensional arrays, you can use comma-separated indices.

```python
b[0, 0]  # Output: 1
b[0, :] # Output: array([1, 2, 3]) - This gives the first row
b[:, 0]  # Output: array([1, 4]) - This gives the first column
b[0, 1:]  # Output: array([2, 3])
b[:, 0]  # Output: array([1, 4]) - This gives the first column
```

#### **5. Matrices and Matrix Operations**

NumPy can perform many operations on arrays like arithmetic, dot product, cross product, etc.

```python

a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
b = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
c = np.array([1, 2, 3], dtype='float32')

# Arithmetic operations
a + c # Output: array([2., 4., 6.])
a - c # Output: array([0., 0., 0.])
a * c # Output: array([1., 4., 9.])
a / c # Output: array([1., 1., 1.])

# Matrix multiplication
d = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])
matrix_produt = np.matmul(a, d) # Output: array([22, 28])

# Transpose
d.T # Output: array([[1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6]])

# Dot product
np.dot(a, d) # Output: array([22, 28])

d = np.arange(9).reshape(3, 3) # Output: array([[0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8]])

# vstack
np.vstack((a, a)) # Output: array([[1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3]])


# Inverse
np.linalg.inv(d) # Output: array([[ 0.66666667, -1.33333333,  0.66666667], [-1.33333333,  2.66666667, -1.33333333], [ 0.66666667, -1.33333333,  0.66666667]])

# Determinant
np.linalg.det(d) # Output: 0.0

# axis
# axis=0 means along the column and axis=1 means working along the row axis = 2 means working along the depth axis and so on.
np.sum(d, axis=0) # Output: array([ 9, 12, 15]) - Sum along columns
np.sum(d, axis=1) # Output: array([ 3, 12, 21]) - Sum along rows

# mean
np.mean(d) # Output: 4.0
np.mean(d, axis=0) # Output: array([3., 4., 5.]) - Mean along columns


```

#### **6. Basic Statistics, operations and functions with NumPy**

You can perform statistical operations on arrays such as finding the mean, median, standard deviation, etc.

1. Basic Statistics

```python
a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

print(np.mean(a))  # Output: 3.0
print(np.median(a))  # Output: 3.0
print(np.std(a))  # Output: 1.4142135623730951
```

2. Arthimetic Operations

```python
a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
b = np.array([6, 7, 8, 9, 10])

print(a + 1)  # Output: array([2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
print(a - 1)  # Output: array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])
print(a * 2)  # Output: array([ 2,  4,  6,  8, 10])
print(a / 2)  # Output: array([0.5, 1. , 1.5, 2. , 2.5])

print(a + b)  # Output: array([ 7,  9, 11, 13, 15])
print(a - b)  # Output: array([-5, -5, -5, -5, -5])
print(a * b)  # Output: array([ 6, 14, 24, 36, 50])
print(a / b)  # Output: array([0.16666667, 0.28571429, 0.375     , 0.44444444, 0.5       ])
```

3. Universal Functions

```python
a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

np.exp(a)
np.log(a)
np.sqrt(a)
np.sin(a)
np.cos(a)
```

These are the very basics of NumPy. There are many more features like broadcasting, mask arrays, structured arrays, etc., but this should be a good starting point. The official NumPy documentation is a great place to learn more.

#### Exercise

Suppose you have an image (RGB). Each pixel in the image is represented by three integers (0-255) representing the intensity of the Red, Green and Blue channels respectively. You want to convert this image to grayscale. How would you do it using NumPy?

Solution:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Random 100x100 RGB image
image = np.random.randint(0, 256, (100, 100, 3), dtype=np.uint8)

# Displaying original image
plt.imshow(image)
plt.title('Original Image')
plt.show()

# Convert to grayscale: using weights for R, G, B -> 0.299, 0.587, 0.114
grayscale_image = np.dot(image[...,:3], [0.299, 0.587, 0.114])
# `image[...,:3]` This part of the code takes the input color image, which is usually represented as a NumPy array with shape (height, width, 3). The :3 slice selects the first three color channels, which correspond to the red, green, and blue channels.

# Displaying grayscale image
plt.imshow(grayscale_image, cmap='gray')
plt.title('Grayscale Image')
plt.show()

# Image inversion
inverted_image = 255 - image

# Displaying inverted image
plt.imshow(inverted_image)
plt.title('Inverted Image')
plt.show()

```

### **2. Pandas**

**Pandas**

Pandas is a library built on top of NumPy, and provides an efficient implementation of a DataFrame. DataFrames are essentially multidimensional arrays with attached row and column labels, and often with heterogeneous types and/or missing data. Pandas implements a number of powerful data operations familiar to users of both database frameworks and spreadsheet programs.

**1. Importing Pandas**

First, you need to import the library:

```python
import pandas as pd
```

**2. Creating DataFrames**

DataFrames can be created in different ways, such as from a Python dictionary, a list, or even NumPy arrays:

- From a dictionary:

```python
data = {
    'apples': [3, 2, 0, 1],
    'oranges': [0, 3, 7, 2]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df)
```

- From a list of dictionaries:

```python
data = [
    {'a': 1, 'b': 2},
    {'a': 5, 'b': 10, 'c': 20}
]
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df)
```

**3. Reading/Writing Data**

Pandas can read and write data in various formats including CSV, Excel, SQL databases, and even the clipboard:

- Reading data from a CSV file:

```python
df = pd.read_csv('filename.csv')
```

- Writing data to a CSV file:

```python
df.to_csv('new_filename.csv', index=False)
```

**4. Indexing and Slicing**

Pandas provides several methods to access the data in a DataFrame:

- Accessing a single column:

```python
df['column_name']
```

- Accessing multiple columns:

```python
df[['column_name1', 'column_name2']]
```

- Accessing rows by index:

```python
df.loc[row_label]
df.iloc[row_index]
```

- Accessing a single element:

```python
data = {'A': [1, 2, 3], 'B': [4, 5, 6]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Access an element by label (row label '1', column label 'A')
element1 = df.loc[1, 'A']

# Access an element by position (row position 1, column position 0)
element2 = df.iloc[1, 0]

print(element1)  # Output: 2
print(element2)  # Output: 2
```

**5. Grouping**

Pandas allows grouping data for aggregation or transformation:

```python
df.groupby('column_name').sum()
```

**6. Merging Data**

DataFrames can be merged in different ways like inner join, outer join, left join, and right join:

```python
merged_df = pd.merge(df1, df2, on='common_column') # inner join by default
merged_df = pd.merge(df1, df2, on='common_column', how='outer') # outer join
```

**7. Handling Missing Data**

Pandas provides methods to handle missing data:

- Checking for missing data:

```python
df.isnull()
```

- Dropping missing data:

```python
df.dropna()
```

- Filling in missing data:

```python
df.fillna(value)
```

This is a very basic introduction to Pandas. There's much more to the library, including reshaping data, pivot tables, date functionality, etc. The official Pandas documentation is a great place to learn more.

#### Exercise

Below is a problem statement that requires using Pandas in Python. This problem will test your understanding of data manipulation, filtering, grouping, and summarization with Pandas.

### Problem Statement: Sales Data Analysis

**Background**: You are given a dataset, `sales_data.csv`, which contains sales records of a retail store. The dataset has the following columns:

- `OrderID`: Unique ID for each order
- `Product`: Name of the product
- `QuantityOrdered`: Number of items ordered
- `PriceEach`: Price of each item
- `OrderDate`: Date and time the order was placed (format: 'MM/DD/YY HH:mm')
- `PurchaseAddress`: Address where the order was shipped

**Tasks**:

1. **Data Cleaning**: The dataset might have some rows with missing values or invalid data. Clean the dataset by removing these rows.

2. **Add Additional Columns**:

   - Add a `Month` column extracted from `OrderDate`.
   - Add a `Sales` column, which is `QuantityOrdered` multiplied by `PriceEach`.

3. **Analysis Questions**:

   - **Q1**: What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
   - **Q2**: What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most?
   - **Q3**: What city had the highest number of sales?

   **Hints**:

   - You might need to extract the city from the `PurchaseAddress`. Consider using `.apply()` function with a custom lambda function.
   - Use groupby to aggregate sales data for the questions.

4. **Visualization** (Optional but recommended):
   - Plot a bar chart showing sales for each month.
   - Plot a bar chart showing the quantity ordered of each product. Consider adding a secondary y-axis to show the prices of products as a line plot.

**Requirements**:

- Use Pandas for data manipulation.
- (Optional) Use Matplotlib or Seaborn for plotting.

**Deliverables**:

1. A clean dataset after performing the data cleaning step.
2. Code for adding the new columns and the dataframe showing these changes.
3. Answers to the analysis questions along with the code used to find those answers.
4. (Optional) Visualizations for the analysis questions with proper labels and titles.

This problem will test your ability to manipulate and analyze data using Pandas, providing insights from a real-world dataset.

**Solution:**

To solve this problem, we'll proceed step by step, assuming you have a dataset named `sales_data.csv`. Since I can't execute real Python code that interacts with files or display actual plots here, I'll provide you with the code snippets and explanations for each step. You can run these snippets in your local environment.

### Step 1: Data Cleaning

First, let's load the dataset and handle missing or invalid data.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('sales_data.csv')

# Check for missing values
print(df.isnull().sum())

# Drop rows with missing values
df = df.dropna(how='any')

# Removing rows based on a condition - for example, invalid OrderDate
df = df[df['OrderDate'].str[0:2] != 'Or']

# Convert columns to the correct type
df['QuantityOrdered'] = pd.to_numeric(df['QuantityOrdered'])
df['PriceEach'] = pd.to_numeric(df['PriceEach'])
```

### Step 2: Add Additional Columns

Now, let's add the `Month` and `Sales` columns.

```python
# Add Month column
df['Month'] = df['OrderDate'].str[0:2].astype(int)

# Add Sales column
df['Sales'] = df['QuantityOrdered'] * df['PriceEach']
```

### Step 3: Analysis Questions

#### Q1: Best month for sales and earnings

```python
results = df.groupby('Month').sum()

best_month = results['Sales'].idxmax()
best_month_sales = results['Sales'].max()

print(f"The best month for sales was: {best_month} with earnings: ${best_month_sales}")
```

#### Q2: Most sold product

```python
product_group = df.groupby('Product')
quantity_ordered = product_group.sum()['QuantityOrdered']

best_selling_product = quantity_ordered.idxmax()
best_selling_product_quantity = quantity_ordered.max()

print(f"The most sold product was: {best_selling_product} with a quantity of: {best_selling_product_quantity}")
```

#### Q3: City with the highest number of sales

```python
# Extract city from PurchaseAddress
def get_city(address):
    return address.split(",")[1].strip()

df['City'] = df['PurchaseAddress'].apply(lambda x: get_city(x))

city_results = df.groupby('City').sum()

best_city = city_results['Sales'].idxmax()
best_city_sales = city_results['Sales'].max()

print(f"The city with the highest number of sales was: {best_city} with sales: ${best_city_sales}")
```

### Step 4: Visualization (Optional)

For visualization, ensure you have `matplotlib` installed (`pip install matplotlib`).

#### Sales for Each Month

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

months = range(1, 13)
plt.bar(months, results['Sales'])
plt.xticks(months)
plt.ylabel('Sales in USD ($)')
plt.xlabel('Month')
plt.show()
```

#### Quantity Ordered of Each Product

```python
products = [product for product, df in product_group]
plt.bar(products, quantity_ordered)
plt.ylabel('Quantity Ordered')
plt.xticks(products, rotation='vertical', size=8)
plt.show()
```

Run these snippets in your Python environment to perform the analysis and visualizations. Each step demonstrates essential data manipulation tasks in pandas, such as grouping, aggregating, and plotting data.

### ** 3.1 Matplotlib**

Matplotlib is a plotting library for Python and NumPy that provides a MATLAB-like interface. It is great for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

**1. Importing Matplotlib**

First, you need to import the library:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

**2. Line Plot**

A line plot can be created using the `plot()` function:

```python
import numpy as np

x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
y = np.sin(x)

plt.plot(x, y)
plt.show()
```

**3. Scatter Plot**

A scatter plot can be created using the `scatter()` function:

```python
x = np.random.randn(100)
y = np.random.randn(100)

plt.scatter(x, y)
plt.show()
```

**4. Histogram**

A histogram can be created using the `hist()` function:

```python
x = np.random.randn(1000)

plt.hist(x, bins=30)
plt.show()
```

**5. Customizing Plots**

There are many ways to customize plots. For example, you can add labels, title, grid, etc.:

```python
x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
y = np.sin(x)

plt.plot(x, y)
plt.title('Sine Wave')
plt.xlabel('x')
plt.ylabel('y')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

---

### **3.2 Seaborn**

Seaborn is a library for making statistical graphics in Python. It is built on top of Matplotlib and closely integrated with pandas data structures.

**1. Importing Seaborn**

First, you need to import the library:

```python
import seaborn as sns
```

**2. Heatmap**

A heatmap can be created using the `heatmap()` function:

```python
# Create a random dataset
data = np.random.rand(10, 12)

# Create a heatmap
sns.heatmap(data)
plt.show()
```

**3. Pairplot**

A pairplot can be created using the `pairplot()` function:

```python
# Import seaborn and load the iris dataset
import seaborn as sns
iris = sns.load_dataset("iris")

# Create a pairplot
sns.pairplot(iris)
plt.show()
```

**4. Customizing Seaborn Plots**

You can customize Seaborn plots using Matplotlib functions, as Seaborn is built on top of Matplotlib:

```python
# Create a random dataset
data = np.random.rand(10, 12)

# Create a heatmap
sns.heatmap(data)

# Customize the plot
plt.title('Heatmap')
plt.show()
```

Both Matplotlib and Seaborn provide more advanced functionality than covered here, including different types of plots, different ways to customize plots, and different ways to handle and visualize more complex data. The official documentation of both libraries is a great resource to learn more.

### Example of a simple Data Science Project

A comprehensive task that involves data manipulation with Pandas, numerical operations with NumPy, and visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn. This task is designed to test a wide range of skills suitable for a data analyst or data engineer.

### **Task: Financial Market Analysis**

**Background**: You are given two datasets: `stock_prices.csv` and `trading_volume.csv`. Each dataset contains daily data for several stocks over a period of one year. The columns in both datasets include `Date`, `Stock`, and either `ClosePrice` (for `stock_prices.csv`) or `Volume` (for `trading_volume.csv`).

#### **Objectives**:

1. **Data Preparation and Cleaning**:

   - Load both datasets using Pandas.
   - Convert the `Date` column to a datetime format.
   - Check for and handle any missing values in both datasets. If a stock's data is missing for a day, forward-fill the data from the last available day.
   - Merge both datasets on `Date` and `Stock` into a single DataFrame.

2. **Feature Engineering**:

   - Calculate the daily return for each stock: (Today's Close Price - Yesterday's Close Price) / Yesterday's Close Price.
   - Calculate a 7-day rolling average for both the `ClosePrice` and `Volume` for each stock.
   - Add a column that categorizes the day as `HighVol` if the trading volume for a stock is above its 30-day rolling average, and `LowVol` otherwise.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:

   - Identify the top 5 stocks with the highest average close price over the period and plot their daily closing prices over time.
   - Calculate and visualize the correlation matrix between the daily returns of the stocks.
   - For each stock, plot a scatterplot of daily return vs. volume, colored by the `HighVol`/`LowVol` category.

4. **Advanced Analysis**:

   - Perform a comparative analysis to see how well each stock performs on `HighVol` days vs. `LowVol` days. Use aggregated metrics like average daily return and volatility (standard deviation of daily return).
   - Identify any outliers in daily returns for each stock using a box plot. Discuss possible reasons for these outliers.

5. **Predictive Modeling (Optional)**:

   - Choose one stock. Build a simple linear regression model to predict its next day's close price using the previous day's close price, volume, and rolling averages as features.
   - Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.

6. **Visualization and Reporting**:
   - Use Matplotlib and Seaborn for all visualizations.
   - Ensure all plots have appropriate titles, labels, and legends.
   - Compile a final report summarizing the key findings and insights from the analyses, including interpretations of the plots and model results.

#### **Deliverables**:

- Cleaned and merged DataFrame.
- Code for feature engineering and EDA, with outputs and plots.
- Analysis on `HighVol` vs. `LowVol` days.
- Discussion on stock performance outliers.
- (Optional) Linear regression model code, evaluation, and insights.
- A written summary report with all findings and visualizations.

### **Skills Tested**:

- **Pandas**: Data cleaning, manipulation, merging, and aggregation.
- **NumPy**: Numerical operations, especially for feature engineering.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Creating various types of plots for EDA and reporting.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Correlation, outliers identification, and linear regression modeling.
- **Critical Thinking**: Deriving insights from complex data, explaining outliers, and evaluating stock performance.

This task covers a wide spectrum of data analysis operations, from data preparation to deep analysis and modeling, culminating in a comprehensive report that showcases findings and insights in a clear and actionable manner.

### **Solution**:

We'll proceed step-by-step, focusing on methodology and code snippets that you can execute in your Python environment. This walkthrough covers data preparation, cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and advanced analysis.

### **Step 1: Data Preparation and Cleaning**

First, ensure you have `pandas` installed. If not, install it using `pip install pandas`.

**1.1 Loading the Datasets**

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the datasets
stock_prices = pd.read_csv('stock_prices.csv')
trading_volume = pd.read_csv('trading_volume.csv')
```

**1.2 Converting Date Columns**

```python
stock_prices['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(stock_prices['Date'])
trading_volume['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(trading_volume['Date'])
```

**1.3 Handling Missing Values**

```python
# fillna() function to forward-fill missing values from the last available day
stock_prices.fillna(method='ffill', inplace=True)
trading_volume.fillna(method='ffill', inplace=True)
```

**1.4 Merging the Datasets**

```python
# Merge the datasets on Date and Stock columns using an inner join (default) to keep only the rows that are present in both datasets and drop the rest (outer join will keep all rows)
merged_data = pd.merge(stock_prices, trading_volume, on=['Date', 'Stock'])
```

### **Step 2: Feature Engineering**

**2.1 Daily Return Calculation**

```python
# Grouping data by Stock and calculating daily return for each stock using pct_change() function to calculate the percentage change between the current and a prior element
merged_data['DailyReturn'] = merged_data.groupby('Stock')['ClosePrice'].pct_change()
```

**2.2 Rolling Averages**

```python
# Using rolling() function to calculate the rolling average for each stock over a 7-day window and adding the results as new columns to the DataFrame using transform() function to apply the rolling function to each group separately and return a DataFrame with the same index as the original object filled with the transformed values
merged_data['RollingAvgClose_7d'] = merged_data.groupby('Stock')['ClosePrice'].transform(lambda x: x.rolling(window=7).mean())
merged_data['RollingAvgVol_7d'] = merged_data.groupby('Stock')['Volume'].transform(lambda x: x.rolling(window=7).mean())
```

**2.3 High/Low Volume Column**

```python
# Adding a new column to the DataFrame that categorizes each day as HighVol or LowVol based on whether the volume for a stock is above its 30-day rolling average or not using transform() function to apply the rolling function to each group separately and return a DataFrame with the same index as the original object filled with the transformed values
merged_data['VolCategory'] = np.where(merged_data['Volume'] > merged_data.groupby('Stock')['Volume'].transform(lambda x: x.rolling(window=30).mean()), 'HighVol', 'LowVol')
```

### **Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

**3.1 Top 5 Stocks by Average Close Price**

```python
top5_stocks = merged_data.groupby('Stock')['ClosePrice'].mean().nlargest(5).index

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

for stock in top5_stocks:
    subset = merged_data[merged_data['Stock'] == stock]
    plt.plot(subset['Date'], subset['ClosePrice'], label=stock)

plt.legend()
plt.title('Top 5 Stocks by Average Close Price')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Close Price')
plt.show()
```

**3.2 Correlation Matrix of Daily Returns**

```python
pivot_daily_returns = merged_data.pivot_table(index='Date', columns='Stock', values='DailyReturn')
corr_matrix = pivot_daily_returns.corr()

sns.heatmap(corr_matrix, annot=True)
plt.title('Correlation Matrix of Daily Returns')
plt.show()
```

**3.3 Scatterplot of Daily Return vs. Volume**

```python
# This example is for one stock. Repeat for each stock or modify for a general case.
stock_example = 'AAPL'
subset = merged_data[merged_data['Stock'] == stock_example]

sns.scatterplot(data=subset, x='Volume', y='DailyReturn', hue='VolCategory')
plt.title(f'Daily Return vs. Volume for {stock_example}')
plt.show()
```

### **Step 4: Advanced Analysis**

**4.1 Comparative Analysis on HighVol vs. LowVol Days**

```python
# Grouping data by Stock and VolCategory
grouped = merged_data.groupby(['Stock', 'VolCategory'])['DailyReturn'].agg(['mean', 'std']).unstack()

print(grouped)
```

**4.2 Identifying Outliers in Daily Returns**

```python
# For one stock, repeat or adjust for a general case
sns.boxplot(data=merged_data[merged_data['Stock'] == stock_example], x='DailyReturn')
plt.title(f'Outliers in Daily Returns for {stock_example}')
plt.show()
```

Continuing from where we left off, let's delve into predictive modeling and report compilation, which were identified as optional but essential steps for a comprehensive analysis.

### **Step 5: Predictive Modeling (Optional)**

In this section, we'll create a simple linear regression model to predict the next day's close price for a single stock, say 'AAPL', using previous day's data.

**5.1 Preparing the Data**

We'll use the `ClosePrice`, `Volume`, and `RollingAvgClose_7d` from the previous day as features to predict the next day's `ClosePrice`.

```python
# Filtering data for the stock 'AAPL'
aapl_data = merged_data[merged_data['Stock'] == 'AAPL'].copy()

# Adding lagged features for the previous day
aapl_data['PrevClose'] = aapl_data['ClosePrice'].shift(1)
aapl_data['PrevVolume'] = aapl_data['Volume'].shift(1)
aapl_data['PrevRollingAvgClose_7d'] = aapl_data['RollingAvgClose_7d'].shift(1)

# Dropping NaN values (first row now contains NaN because of the shift operation)
aapl_data.dropna(inplace=True)

# Defining features and target variable
features = ['PrevClose', 'PrevVolume', 'PrevRollingAvgClose_7d']
X = aapl_data[features]
y = aapl_data['ClosePrice']
```

**5.2 Splitting the Data into Training and Testing Sets**

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

**5.3 Building and Training the Model**

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Making predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluating the model
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions)
print(f'Mean Squared Error: {mse}')
```

### **Step 6: Visualization and Reporting**

The final step is to compile our findings into a comprehensive report. This report should summarize the key insights from the data cleaning, feature engineering, EDA, advanced analysis, and predictive modeling steps. It should also include visualizations created in the previous steps.

**Key Points for the Report:**

1. **Introduction**: Briefly introduce the datasets and the objectives of the analysis.
2. **Data Preparation and Cleaning**: Summarize the cleaning and preprocessing steps.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Describe the new features created and their rationale.
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Discuss the findings from the EDA, supported by visualizations. Highlight trends in stock prices, volume, and any interesting patterns observed.
5. **Advanced Analysis**: Present the insights from the comparative analysis of `HighVol` vs. `LowVol` days and the outlier analysis. Discuss potential reasons for observed outliers.
6. **Predictive Modeling**: Describe the approach, features used, model performance, and any limitations or assumptions made.
7. **Conclusion**: Summarize the key findings and suggest areas for further research or analysis.

**Final Note**:

This comprehensive task blends data manipulation, analysis, modeling, and visualization, challenging you to apply a wide range of data science skills. Tailor the report to your audience, ensuring that technical details are balanced with high-level insights. This approach not only tests your analytical and engineering skills but also your ability to communicate complex information clearly and concisely.
