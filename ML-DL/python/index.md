Absolutely, Python is a great starting point for diving into Machine Learning and Deep Learning. It is widely used in the community and most of the libraries and frameworks are built around it. Here are the topics and subtopics you should cover:

**1. Basic Python**

- Introduction to Python: Overview of Python, why it's used in ML/DL, installing Python.
- Python Syntax: Variables, operators, data types, strings, boolean type, etc.
- Control Flow: If-else statements, loops (for and while loops).
- Data Structures: Lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries.
- Functions: Defining and calling functions, variable scope.
- File I/O: Reading from and writing to files.
- Exception Handling: Try, except, finally blocks, raising exceptions.

**2. Intermediate Python**

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Classes and objects, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism.
- Functional Programming: Lambda functions, map, reduce, filter functions.
- List Comprehensions, Dictionary Comprehensions.
- Modules and Packages: Importing modules, installing and using packages.
- Debugging and Testing: Using pdb, writing unit tests using unittest or pytest.

**3. Python for Data Analysis**

- NumPy: Array creation, indexing, slicing, operations on arrays, broadcasting, random number generation.
- Pandas: Creating DataFrames, reading/writing data, indexing, slicing, grouping, merging data, handling missing data.
- Matplotlib: Creating different types of plots - line plot, scatter plot, histogram, etc., customizing plots.
- Seaborn: Advanced statistical plots - heatmaps, pairplots, etc.

**4. Python for Machine Learning**

- Scikit-learn: Preprocessing data, creating ML models, training and evaluating models, performing cross-validation, grid search.
- Statsmodels: Statistical models, hypothesis testing.

**5. Python for Deep Learning**

- TensorFlow: Understanding tensors, operations on tensors, creating neural networks, training and evaluating models, saving and loading models.
- Keras (Now part of TensorFlow): High-level API to build and train deep learning models.
- PyTorch: Understanding tensors in PyTorch, creating neural networks, training and evaluating models.

**6. Additional Libraries and Tools**

- SciPy: For more advanced mathematical functions and operations.
- Scrapy: For web scraping.
- OpenCV: For image and video processing.
- NLTK and Spacy: For natural language processing.

These are the key topics that you need to cover. However, remember that the best way to learn is by doing. Try to work on projects or problems as you learn these concepts to get a better understanding of how to apply them in real-world situations. Also, keep practicing coding in Python - it's a skill that gets better the more you use it.
