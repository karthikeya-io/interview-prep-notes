Scikit-learn is a comprehensive library in Python designed for machine learning. It provides tools for:

- Data preprocessing
- Supervised learning models
- Unsupervised learning models
- Model evaluation and tuning

### **Data Preprocessing**

Before feeding data into a machine learning model, it often needs to be preprocessed. Scikit-learn offers tools for scaling features, encoding categorical variables, filling missing values, and more.

**Example: Standardizing Features**

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
import numpy as np

data = np.array([[5.0, -2.0, 3.0], [4.0, 0.0, 2.0], [1.0, 3.0, 9.0]])
scaler = StandardScaler()
data_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(data) # Standardizing data using StandardScaler which removes the mean and scales the data to unit variance (mean = 0 and variance = 1)

print(data_scaled)
```

### **Supervised Learning Models**

Supervised learning is where you have input variables (X) and an output variable (Y), and you use an algorithm to learn the mapping function from the input to the output.

#### **1. Linear Regression**

Used for predicting a continuous value. For example, predicting house prices based on features like square footage and number of bedrooms.

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Sample data
X = [[1], [2], [3], [4]]  # Features
y = [2, 4, 6, 8]  # Target values

# Splitting data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Creating and training the model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Making predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

print(predictions)
```

#### **2. Logistic Regression**

Used for binary classification problems. For example, classifying emails as spam or not spam.

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification

# Generating synthetic data
# n_features = 2: 2 features per sample (X), n_redundant = 0: no redundant features, n_informative = 2: 2 informative features, n_clusters_per_class = 1: 1 cluster per class
X, y = make_classification(n_features=2, n_redundant=0, n_informative=2, random_state=1, n_clusters_per_class=1)

# Splitting the dataset
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Creating the model and training it
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Making predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

print(predictions)
```

### **Unsupervised Learning Models**

Unsupervised learning is where you only have input data (X) and no corresponding output variables. The goal for unsupervised learning is to model the underlying structure or distribution in the data.

#### **1. K-Means Clustering**

Used for grouping data into clusters. For example, customer segmentation.

```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
import numpy as np

# Sample data
X = np.array([[1, 2], [1, 4], [1, 0], [10, 2], [10, 4], [10, 0]])

# Creating the model and fitting it
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=2, random_state=0).fit(X)

# Predicting clusters
clusters = kmeans.predict(X)

print(clusters)
```

### **Model Evaluation and Tuning**

Scikit-learn provides tools to evaluate the performance of models and to fine-tune their parameters.

#### **Cross-Validation**

Cross-validation is a technique for evaluating ML models by training several ML models on subsets of the available input data and evaluating them on the complementary subset of the data.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Sample data
X = np.array([[1], [2], [3], [4], [5]])
y = np.array([2, 4, 6, 8, 10])

# Creating the model
model = LinearRegression()

# Evaluating the model using cross-validation
scores = cross_val_score(model, X, y, cv=5)

print(scores)
```

#### **Grid Search**

Grid search is used to tune hyperparameters by defining a grid of parameters that will be searched using K-fold cross-validation.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
from sklearn.svm import SVC

# Generate some data
X, y = make_classification(n_samples=100, n_features=4)

# Define parameter grid
param_grid = {'C': [0.1, 1, 10], 'kernel': ['linear', 'rbf']}

# Initialize the model
model = SVC()

# Initialize GridSearchCV
grid_search = GridSearchCV(model, param_grid, cv=5)

# Fit GridSearchCV
grid_search.fit(X, y)

print(f'Best parameters: {grid_search.best_params_}')

```
